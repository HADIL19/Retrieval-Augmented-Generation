Retrieval-Augmented Generation

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
It’s a smart way to make AI answers more accurate and up-to-date by letting the model look things up before it responds.

The idea in plain English

Instead of an AI answering only from memory, RAG lets it:

Search for relevant info (documents, PDFs, database rows, web pages, etc.)

Retrieve the most useful pieces

Generate an answer using that retrieved info

So it’s basically:

🔍 Search first → 🧠 Answer smarter

Why RAG exists

Normal LLMs:

Can hallucinate

Don’t know your private data

Are limited to their training cutoff

RAG fixes that by plugging the model into your own data.

How RAG works (step by step)

You ask a question
“What are our company’s leave policies?”

The system converts your question into embeddings

It searches a vector database (Pinecone, FAISS, Chroma, etc.)

Retrieves the most relevant documents

Sends them + your question to the LLM

The LLM answers based on real sources

Simple architecture
User → Query
      ↓
  Vector Search (Docs)
      ↓
 Retrieved Context
      ↓
   LLM → Answer

Example use cases

📄 Chat with PDFs / docs

🏢 Internal company chatbot

📚 Study assistant using course material

🏥 Medical / legal knowledge systems

🛠️ Dev tools (chat with codebase)

RAG vs Fine-tuning
RAG	Fine-tuning
Uses external data	Changes model weights
Easy to update data	Expensive
Great for facts	Great for style/behavior
Less hallucination	Still can hallucinate

👉 Most real systems use RAG
